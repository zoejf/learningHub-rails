      <p>Scope's mission is to make learning easier. As you set out to learn a new programming-related skill and are unsure of where to start, Scope wants to simplify the research process by bringing a lot of different information to one place. </p>
      <p>Once you have a Scope account, you can bookmark resources that you want to save for later, as well as leave comments to help others as they begin their search for new skills. <%= link_to "Sign up here", signup_path %></p>
